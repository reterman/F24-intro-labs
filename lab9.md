# CI/CD Lab - GitHub Actions

In this lab, you will explore continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices using GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions provides a powerful workflow automation tool to streamline your development and deployment processes. You will perform various tasks related to setting up CI/CD pipelines and gathering system information using GitHub Actions. Follow the tasks below to complete the lab assignment.

## Task 1: Create Your First GitHub Actions Pipeline

**Objective**: Set up a basic GitHub Actions workflow and observe its execution.

1. **Read the Official Guide**:
   - Follow the official GitHub Actions [quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart).
   - Document all your observations, key concepts, and steps you followed in a Markdown file named `submission9.md` in the lab folder.

2. **Observe the Workflow Execution**:
   - Push some changes to your repository and observe the GitHub Actions workflow execution.
   - Document the output, any errors encountered, and any observations in the same `submission9.md` file.

## Task 2: Gathering System Information and Manual Triggering

**Objective**: Extend your workflow to include manual triggering and system information gathering.

1. **Configure a Manual Trigger**:
   - Extend your existing GitHub Actions workflow to include a [manual trigger](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#defining-inputs-for-manually-triggered-workflows).
   - Inputs for manually triggered workflows are not needed, so you can skip them.
   - Document the changes made to the workflow file in the same `submission9.md` file.
   - Refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow) if you face any issues.

2. **Gather System Information**:
   - Modify your workflow to include an additional step for gathering system information.
   - Use the appropriate actions and steps to collect information about the runner, hardware specifications, and operating system details.
   - Document the changes made to the workflow file and the gathered system information in the same `submission9.md` file.

### Documentation

- **Create `submission9.md` file**:
  - Include your observations, key concepts, and steps followed from the quickstart guide.
  - Document the workflow execution output, any errors encountered, and observations.
  - Document the changes made to include manual triggering.
  - Include the gathered system information and the commands used.

### Guidelines

- Use proper Markdown formatting and structure for the documentation files.
- Organize the files within the lab folder using appropriate naming conventions.
- Create a Pull Request to the main branch of the repository with your completed lab assignment.

> Note: Actively explore GitHub Actions and CI/CD practices to enhance your development and deployment workflows. Use the official guide and documentation as a starting point and document your observations along the way.
